This is a web app for the card game, "Battle Line". It's a personal project that will allow some friends to play the game online.
Here's how to start the app:
1. Install the dependencies with yarn or npm
```

npm install

```
or 

```

yarn install

```
2. The project uses vite/react. You can start the project using the run dev command.
```

npm run dev

```
or

```

yarn run dev

```
3. Enjoy! If you want to deploy the site, follow the instructions on the hosting platform. Github pages will need to use github actions and a .yaml file.


The project is still a work in progress. Here are some major tasks that still need to be done:

1. Add multiplayer functionalities - allow players to join lobbies and host games.
2. Add tactics cards as a option
3. Improve the look of the cards
4. Allow player to "prove" that the flag is won - This is currently done automatically. Maybe think about making it manual (evaluate flag by clicking on it?)
5. Add a user login platform.
